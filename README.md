# Course Rating App - _mandatory assignment_
## Guide
When you open the application you will be presented with a main menu. The "RATE A COURSE" button is disabled untill you login. 
So start by loggin in. In the LoginActivity there is a pseudo loginvalidation (for the time being) which only grants access to the username "user". You do not have to enter a certain password.
From here on the application should be pretty self-explanatory (fingers crossed)!

## Thoughts
I've tried my best to make the code scale dynamically. So as far as I can tell it would be very easy to implement a database.
There are definitely a lot of things that can be done a whole lot smarter. Fx. I'm not quite sure that using a LinkedHashMap 
with the question strings as key was a good idea. But yeah... to make a long story short: If I get the time there is a lot of cleaning up to do.

## A few disclaimers
This is very much an alpha edition of the app. I've cut corners wherever I saw it fit.
I've been very busy the last few couple of weeks. 
At least it is good practice to see what you are capable of while under pressure.
